        VCF Developers Are Allowed to Work Freely However They Want and When They Want Because VCF Has Not Established
        Any On-Ground Business or Development Place Yet. Our Developers Are Always Allowed to Come up with New Ideas and
        Technologies. Rather than Having a Leader, We Give Everyone Chances to Speak or Put Their Point of View on
        Certain Projects or Topics. We Have Made a Set of Rules That Every Vcf Member Needs to Follow so That We May
        Seem Different from All the Crowd. Every New Project Idea Is Shared Between All the Developers and Developers
        Where Every Suggestion Is Compared with Others and Selected If It Meets the Requirements.
      </p>

      <p class="content is-family-sans-serif is-size-6 is-size-7-mobile py-5 has-text-justified">Overall We Work In A
        Democratic Environment Where nothing is static we change our rules and strategies whenever it's essential.
        <strong> In VCF Everything Is Dynamic</strong></p>
